# What is pixi-loopkit

Loopkit makes it a good deal simpler to create looping gifs, visualisations that are timed perfectly to music,
experiments that are easy to parametrize (more on that in props!), and much more.

In technical terms, it's a thin wrapper around PIXI.js with additional helper scripts and libraries. In a way, it's a
platform to create stuff.

This documentation is a cross between a guide and techincal documentation, a how to do stuff in general, and how to do
stuff in loopkit in specific. Have a look around and who knows, maybe you'll have found your new home!

# Installing & Running

```
npm install pixi-loopkit
```
